# Element Cattos Decomp

Element Cattos is a 2D pixel science sandbox where you can play around with elements as cats! or so called... Cattos! You can view more in Oberorka's itch.io page: https://oberorka.itch.io/elementcattos
This repository acts as an archive of this game starting from version Alpha 0.13 and onwards, while also being a mod of mine!

This branch contains my modded code for version 0.13a!
Branches with _4.1.1 as of now are original decomps of the executable, while those without it are ports to the latest Godot version.
